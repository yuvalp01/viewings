# Next.js Specific Rules
- Use App Router conventions (app directory structure)
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed ('use client')
- API routes should be in `app/api/` directory
- Use Next.js built-in components: `next/link`, `next/image`, `next/navigation`
- Prefer Server Actions for mutations when possible
- Use Route Handlers (route.ts) for REST APIs
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper loading states
- Use Next.js caching strategies appropriately
