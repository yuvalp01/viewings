# TypeScript Rules
- Always define types/interfaces for props, API responses, and data structures
- Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Export types from dedicated files when reused
- Keep TypeScript strict mode enabled
