- Prefer functional components and hooks
- Use async/await over promises
- Handle errors gracefully with proper error messages
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Never change the sql server database yourself
