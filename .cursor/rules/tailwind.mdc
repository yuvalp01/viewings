# Tailwind CSS Rules
- Use utility classes directly in JSX
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS
- Use responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- Extract repeated patterns into components, not CSS classes
- Use Tailwind's design tokens (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Keep responsive design mobile-first
